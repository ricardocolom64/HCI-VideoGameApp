# HCI-VideoGameApp

## TO DO
* fix the map code
* clean up the code in general (lots of messy elifs and redundant comments, I (Martin) will see if there's any way to clean that up)
* maybe have all fields blank as default and get the data frame to hide blank columns? there's gotta be a way to do that
* ratings chart implementation (unless somebody's already done that)
* write an actual readme and not whatever this garbage is
* web site
